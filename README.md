# **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)**  

A **Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)** monitors and analyzes network traffic to detect malicious activity, policy violations, or anomalous behaviors in real-time. This project demonstrates the design, implementation, and analysis of a NIDS, leveraging tools and techniques for enhanced network security.

## **Overview**  
Network Intrusion Detection Systems play a critical role in protecting networks by detecting unauthorized access or unusual patterns that may indicate cyberattacks. This project focuses on developing a robust NIDS capable of:  
- Monitoring network traffic in real-time.  
- Identifying suspicious patterns or anomalies.  
- Providing actionable alerts for administrators.  

---

## **Key Features**  
1. **Packet Inspection**: Analyzes network packets for suspicious patterns using predefined rules.  
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual behaviors that deviate from normal traffic.  
3. **Real-Time Alerts**: Notifies administrators about detected threats.  
4. **Extensibility**: Easily integrates with custom rules and modern security tools.  
5. **Logging and Reporting**: Maintains detailed logs for forensic analysis and reporting.  

---

## **System Architecture**  
The NIDS system is designed with the following components:  
1. **Traffic Capture Module**: Uses tools like Wireshark or tcpdump to capture live network traffic.  
2. **Packet Analysis Engine**: Parses captured packets and checks for known signatures.  
3. **Anomaly Detection Engine**: Uses statistical or machine learning models to detect deviations.  
4. **Alerting System**: Triggers alerts via email, logs, or dashboard notifications.  
5. **Dashboard**: Visualizes network activity and intrusion attempts.  

---

## **Tools and Technologies**  
- **Programming Languages**: Python (for packet analysis), Bash (for automation).  
- **Network Monitoring Tools**: Wireshark, tcpdump.  
- **Intrusion Detection Frameworks**: Snort, Suricata.  
- **Machine Learning Libraries** (optional): Scikit-learn, TensorFlow (for anomaly detection).  
- **Visualization Tools**: Grafana, Kibana (for traffic visualization).

## **Installation and Usage**  
### **Prerequisites**  
- Python 3.x installed on your system.  
- Packet capture tools like Wireshark or tcpdump.  
- Optional: Snort or Suricata for signature-based detection.

### **Steps to Install**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/shaolinmonksmonk007/network_intrusion_detection_system.git  
   cd network_intrusion_detection_system  
   ```  
2. Install required dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
3. Configure detection rules (if using Snort or Suricata).  

### **Run the NIDS**  
1. Start capturing traffic:  
   ```bash  
   python capture_traffic.py  
   ```  
2. Analyze traffic for anomalies:  
   ```bash  
   python analyze_traffic.py  
   ```  
3. Visualize results (if using Grafana or Kibana).
